# Markdown Tools (markdown compiler)

## Purpose

This project contains a set of tools to process [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files and produce presentations from them. They main purpose was to generate HTML slides that contain dynamic content to explain Web programming (with HTML, CSS and JavaScript) live in the browser.

The tools can output HTML or LaTeX (using the beamer class and pdflatex or xelatex).

The tools are used for my own lectures and are crafted for my personal needs and were not designed with a general purpose use in mind. They may or may not be useful for your own projects or needs.

In case you perform any improvements to the software, it would be great if you send back your changes via a pull request.

The `data` dictionary contains a sample project that shows the functionality of the tools.

Localization information can be found in the file `lib/messages.rb`.


## Usage

To use the tool, you need the following prerequisites

  * Ruby 2.0
  * GNU Make for building the presentations
  * LaTeX in case you want to generate PDF slides
  * rsync

 A project has this structure
 
     _include
         ...
     01_chapter
         01_section1.md
         02_section2.md
         ...
         Makefile       
         metadata.properties
     02_chapter
     ... 
     compile.sh
     index.sh
     Makefile
     metadata.properties
     presentation.mk

Each presentation is stored in a directory with an arbitrary name beginning with `01_`, `02_`, `03_` etc. Inside the directory there is a Makefile and a file `metadata.properties` containing the meta data of the presentation. Each presentation consists of a number of Markdown files with the content. Each file can contain one or more chapters of the presentation. The chapter begin with a level 1 `#` Markdown heading. The single slides with a level 2 `##` heading.

The main directory of the project contains a simple shell script for compiling (`compile.sh`) the slides and for creating the index.html (`index.sh`). A Makefile included by all presentations (`presentation.mk`) and a central Makefile (`Makefile`) is stored there too. Metadata for the index.html is stored in `metadata.properties`.
