# Markdown Tools

## Purpose

I am a big fan of Markdown and I am currently changing all my workflows to use markdown as the only source and several tools to compile the Markdown input into the desired target formats.

Due to my job, I am performing lots of lectures regarding programming topics. For these, I need presentation slides and text documents containing the contents of the slides plus additional information.

See the readme files in the sub projects for details.
